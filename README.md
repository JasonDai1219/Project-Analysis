# Project-Analysis
This is a project of DSC 80 at University of California San Diego


## Univariate Analysis

Here is the distribution of minutes(excluded extreme outliers) in our adjusted recipes dtataset: *recipes_new*

As we can see most recipes takes less than 3 hours(180 minutes to make).

Here is the distribution of ratings, in our adjusted interactions dataset: *interactions_new*:

In this distribution of ratings across various recipes, we can observe that most recipes have the highest rating score, 5. Then we may wonder that is there a relationship among the timing of a recipe and the rating of a recipe?
Later on, we will explore this question, and now, let us take a look at bivariate analysis of our dataset.

## Bivariate Analysis

Here, we present the scatter plot of timing vs. rating of recipes:
